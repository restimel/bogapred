#Installation

In order to get the project code and to run it, you need a bunch of pre-requist components.

First of all, you need to get the code from Github

	git clone https://

To get started, youâ€™ll need node and npm installed on your computer (https://github.com/nodejs/node/wiki). 

Then move to the root of the Bogapred project and run the command:

	npm install

Note: Previous steps only need to be done once.


After that, you only need to run `gulp` and make your change. The Js will compile automatically on background.

	gulp
